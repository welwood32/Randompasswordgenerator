# PasswordGenarator
Random password generator
 
 I started by writing arrays to conatin the required upper case letters, lower case letters, numbers and special characters for the password generator. I then wrote conditional statements to execute if the user specified a certian type of character . I then wrote an array for password length and used conditional statements to alert the user the required lengths of more than 8 and less than 129 and return them to the generator. Next I wrote a loop to randomly pick a requests array, from there to then randomly pick a character from that requests arrays and add it to the password. Finally I reurned the generated password(output).
